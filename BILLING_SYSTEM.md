# MicroStay Monthly Billing System

## Overview

The MicroStay platform uses a **monthly billing system** where vendors collect full payment from customers and are billed monthly for platform fees.

---

## How It Works

### For Vendors

1. **Collect Full Payment**
   - Vendors receive 100% of the booking amount from customers
   - No upfront deductions or splits

2. **Monthly Invoicing**
   - Platform fees are calculated monthly
   - Invoices generated automatically on the 1st of each month
   - Covers all checked-in bookings from the previous month

3. **Platform Fee Structure**
   - **Fixed Fee**: $5.00 per booking
   - **Percentage Fee**: 8% of gross booking amount
   - **Formula**: $5.00 + (Gross Amount × 0.08)

4. **Payment Timeline**
   - **1st of month**: Invoice generated
   - **5th of month**: Automated reminder sent if unpaid
   - **7th of month**: Properties automatically disabled if still unpaid
   - **After payment**: Admin marks as paid → properties reactivated

---

## Example Calculation

```
Customer books room for: $60.00
Vendor collects: $60.00

Platform fee calculation:
- Fixed fee: $5.00
- Percentage fee: $60.00 × 0.08 = $4.80
- Total platform fee: $5.00 + $4.80 = $9.80

Vendor keeps: $60.00 (collected from customer)
Vendor owes: $9.80 (paid monthly to platform)
```

## Monthly Invoice Flow

### Step 1: Invoice Generation (1st of Month)

**Automated Process:**
- System calculates all checked-in bookings from previous month
- Generates invoice for each vendor with bookings
- Invoice includes:
  - Invoice number (e.g., INV-202603-1234)
  - Billing period (e.g., Feb 1 - Feb 28, 2026)
  - Number of bookings
  - Total revenue collected by vendor
  - Platform fees owed
  - Due date (7 days after month end)

**Admin Action:**
- Click "Generate Monthly Invoices" button in admin dashboard
- System automatically generates for all vendors

### Step 2: Payment Reminder (5th of Month)

**Automated Process:**
- System checks for unpaid invoices
- Sends reminder notifications to vendors
- Updates invoice status to show reminder sent
- No properties affected yet

### Step 3: Auto-Disable (7th of Month)

**Automated Process:**
- System checks for invoices still unpaid
- Automatically disables all properties for vendors with unpaid invoices
- Updates invoice status to "overdue"
- Vendor billing status changed to "suspended"
- Properties no longer appear in customer searches

**Impact on Vendor:**
- Cannot accept new bookings
- Existing bookings still honored
- Must pay invoice to reactivate

### Step 4: Payment Confirmation

**Manual Process (Admin):**
1. Vendor sends payment proof to admin
2. Admin reviews payment proof
3. Admin enters payment proof URL in system
4. Admin clicks "Mark as Paid"
5. System automatically:
   - Updates invoice to "paid" status
   - Reactivates all vendor properties
   - Changes billing status back to "current"
   - Records admin who confirmed payment

## Database Functions

### generate_monthly_invoice(vendor_id, billing_month)

**Purpose**: Create monthly invoice for a vendor

**Logic:**
1. Calculate billing period (previous month)
2. Query all checked-in bookings in period
3. Calculate platform fees: SUM($5 + gross × 0.08)
4. Create invoice with 7-day due date
5. Return invoice ID

**Usage:**
```sql
SELECT generate_monthly_invoice(
  'vendor-uuid-here',
  '2026-03-01'::date
);
```

### process_invoice_reminders()

**Purpose**: Daily job to process automated actions

**Logic:**
- On 5th: Send reminders for unpaid invoices
- On 7th: Disable properties for unpaid invoices

**Usage:**
```sql
SELECT process_invoice_reminders();
```

### mark_invoice_paid(invoice_id, proof_url, admin_id)

**Purpose**: Manually mark invoice as paid

**Logic:**
1. Update invoice to paid status
2. Store payment proof URL
3. Record admin who confirmed
4. Reactivate all vendor properties
5. Update vendor billing status

**Usage:**
```sql
SELECT mark_invoice_paid(
  'invoice-uuid',
  'https://example.com/proof.pdf',
  'admin-uuid'
);
```

## Testing the System

### Test Scenario 1: Normal Payment Flow

1. **Setup**: Create vendor with bookings last month
2. **Day 1**: Admin generates invoices
3. **Day 2-4**: Vendor reviews invoice
4. **Day 5**: Vendor sends payment proof to admin
5. **Day 6**: Admin marks as paid
6. **Result**: Properties stay active, status = "paid"

### Test Scenario 2: Late Payment

1. **Setup**: Create vendor with bookings last month
2. **Day 1**: Admin generates invoices
3. **Day 5**: System sends reminder
4. **Day 7**: System auto-disables properties
5. **Day 10**: Vendor sends payment
6. **Day 11**: Admin marks as paid, properties reactivated
7. **Result**: Properties back online, status = "paid"

### Test Scenario 3: Multiple Invoices

1. **Setup**: Vendor has multiple unpaid invoices
2. **Admin**: Mark oldest invoice as paid first
3. **Check**: Properties remain disabled until ALL overdue invoices paid
4. **Admin**: Mark remaining invoices as paid
5. **Result**: Properties reactivated
